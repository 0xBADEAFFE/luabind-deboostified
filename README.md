luabind
=======

Create Lua bindings for your C++ code easily - my improvements
- Variadic templates.
- Got rid of the arrays created in invoke.
- Lots and lots of boost removed, but still not everything.
- No variadic simulations left.
- No backward compatibility to any old or faulty (MS) compilers.

- Note: This is intended for VC++2013 RC currently and lots of fixups have to be done. (#pragma once etc.)
